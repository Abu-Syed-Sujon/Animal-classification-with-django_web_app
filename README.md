# Animal Image Classification Web App
A Django web application for classifying animal images using a deep learning model based on ResNet152V2. The model is integrated into the backend and leverages image transformation techniques for preprocessing, ensuring high accuracy and robustness.

üìå Features
Upload and classify animal images through a user-friendly web interface.

Deep learning model powered by ResNet152V2, pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for animal species.

Image preprocessing using transformation techniques (resizing, normalization, etc.).

Clean and responsive frontend built with Django templates.

Real-time prediction with confidence scores.
